# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns learning and practice

Various Design Patterns implemented in very simple practical std::cout examples.

Though developed on VS 2017 but code is quite general and does not use anything platform specific. 
Hopefully, just downloading and compiling the files on any OS should get you going.

- Abstract Design Patterns: Fan Factory

- Decorator Design Patterns: Almirah Decorator

- Strategy Design Patterns: Sorting Strategy

... More to come...
